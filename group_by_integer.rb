##Example #2: Grouping integers
The collection: an array of 50 random integers between 1 and 99
The rule: group integers into 5 bins (e.g, 1-19, 20-39â€¦)
=end

# generate random numbers
numbers = (1..99).to_a.sample 5  # 50 = generate 50 random numbers from range 1..99
# group by quotient (number divided by 20)
=begin
The answer after you divide one number by another
dividend Ã· divisor = quotient
Example: in 12 Ã· 3 = 4, 4 is the quotient
